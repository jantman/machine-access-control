## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.12+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/)
- [nox-poetry](https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/)

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ python3 -mvenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install
```

Finally, install and set up pre-commit:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

## Running Locally

```console
$ flask --app dm_mac run
```

The app will now be available at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

To manually run the pre-commit tests:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit
```

Unit tests are located in the [tests/](tests/) directory,
and are written using the [pytest](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/) testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request](https://github.com/jantman/machine_access_control/pulls) to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
